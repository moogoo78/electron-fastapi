Quickstart
Electron is a framework that enables you to create desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These applications can then be packaged to run directly on macOS, Windows, or Linux, or distributed via the Mac App Store or the Microsoft Store.

Typically, you create a desktop application for an operating system (OS) using each operating system's specific native application frameworks. Electron makes it possible to write your application once using technologies that you already know.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with Electron you need to install Node.js. We recommend that you install either the latest LTS or Current version available.

Please install Node.js using pre-built installers for your platform. You may encounter incompatibility issues with different development tools otherwise.

To check that Node.js was installed correctly, type the following commands in your terminal client:

node -v
npm -v
Copy
The commands should print the versions of Node.js and npm accordingly. If both commands succeeded, you are ready to install Electron.

Create a basic application
From a development perspective, an Electron application is essentially a Node.js application. This means that the starting point of your Electron application will be a package.json file like in any other Node.js application. A minimal Electron application has the following structure:

my-electron-app/
├── package.json
├── main.js
├── preload.js
└── index.html
Copy
Let's create a basic application based on the structure above.

Install Electron
Create a folder for your project and install Electron there:

mkdir my-electron-app && cd my-electron-app
npm init -y
npm i --save-dev electron
Copy
Create the main script file
The main script specifies the entry point of your Electron application (in our case, the main.js file) that will run the Main process. Typically, the script that runs in the Main process controls the lifecycle of the application, displays the graphical user interface and its elements, performs native operating system interactions, and creates Renderer processes within web pages. An Electron application can have only one Main process.

The main script may look as follows:

const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
const path = require('path')

function createWindow () {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js')
    }
  })

  win.loadFile('index.html')
}

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow()

  app.on('activate', () => {
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
      createWindow()
    }
  })
})

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit()
  }
})

What is going on above?
Line 1: First, you import the app and BrowserWindow modules of the electron package to be able to manage your application's lifecycle events, as well as create and control browser windows.
Line 2: Second, you import the path package which provides utility functions for file paths.
Line 4: After that, you define a function that creates a new browser window with a preload script, loads index.html file into this window (line 13, we will discuss the file later).
Line 16: You create a new browser window by invoking the createWindow function once the Electron application is initialized.
Line 18: You add a new listener that creates a new browser window only if when the application has no visible windows after being activated. For example, after launching the application for the first time, or re-launching the already running application.
Line 25: You add a new listener that tries to quit the application when it no longer has any open windows. This listener is a no-op on macOS due to the operating system's window management behavior.
Create a web page
This is the web page you want to display once the application is initialized. This web page represents the Renderer process. You can create multiple browser windows, where each window uses its own independent Renderer. You can optionally grant access to additional Node.js APIs by exposing them from your preload script.

The index.html page looks as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello World!</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" />
</head>
<body style="background: white;">
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
        We are using Node.js <span id="node-version"></span>,
        Chromium <span id="chrome-version"></span>,
        and Electron <span id="electron-version"></span>.
    </p>
</body>
</html>
